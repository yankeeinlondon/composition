# Audio Player Implementation - Execution Log

**Plan:** 2025-12-19.audio-player-implementation.md
**Started:** 2025-12-19T14:45:00Z
**Status:** In Progress

## Execution Strategy

### Parallelization Groups

**Group A (Sequential - Foundation):**
- Phase 1: Core Type Definitions and Error Handling - Rust Developer

**Group B (Parallel - Independent Implementations):**
- Phase 2: SurrealDB Cache Schema and Operations - Rust Developer
- Phase 3: Audio Metadata Extraction (Symphonia Integration) - Rust Developer

**Group C (Sequential - Pipeline):**
- Phase 4: Audio Processing Pipeline - Rust Developer

**Group D (Sequential - HTML):**
- Phase 5: HTML Generation - Rust Developer

**Group E (Sequential - Integration):**
- Phase 6: Markdown Parser Integration - Rust Developer

**Group F (Sequential - Polish):**
- Phase 7: CSS Styling and Documentation - Rust Developer

## Pre-Flight Checks

- [x] Working directory has uncommitted changes (expected - docs and plans)
- [x] Tests passing (152 tests passing in lib/)
- [x] Agent files accessible (.claude/agents/)
- [x] Required tools available (cargo, xxhash-rust already in deps)

## Execution Progress

### [2025-12-19T14:45:00Z] - Phase 1 Complete
Principal Owner: Rust Developer
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Duration: ~15 minutes
Key Outcomes:
- Core types implemented (AudioSource, AudioFormat, AudioMetadata, AudioInput, AudioOutput)
- AudioError enum added to centralized error handling
- Test fixtures created (test.mp3, test.wav)
- 19 new tests passing
- No new regressions

### [2025-12-19T15:00:00Z] - Phase 2 Complete
Principal Owner: Rust Developer
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Duration: ~3 minutes
Key Outcomes:
- AudioCache implementation with SurrealDB backend
- audio_cache table schema added
- 7 new tests passing (cache hit/miss, upsert, clear)
- No new regressions

### [2025-12-19T15:03:00Z] - Phase 3 Blocked (Dependency Check)
Principal Owner: Rust Developer
Status: ⚠️ Initially blocked (dependency validation issue)
Note: Phase 3 orchestrator didn't find Phase 1 evidence, but files exist
Resolution: Re-launching Phase 3 with correct context

### [2025-12-19T15:05:00Z] - Phase 3 Complete
Principal Owner: Rust Developer
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Duration: ~5 minutes
Key Outcomes:
- Symphonia integration for metadata extraction
- load_audio_bytes(), detect_audio_format(), compute_content_hash(), extract_audio_metadata()
- 15 new tests passing (35 total audio tests)
- Property tests for hash determinism
- No new regressions

### [2025-12-19T15:10:00Z] - Starting Phase 4
Phase 4: Audio Processing Pipeline - Rust Developer
Status: Launching...
